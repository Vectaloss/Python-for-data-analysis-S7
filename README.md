# Welcome to our project ! 

Our dataset contains values for 41 attributes (molecular descriptors)
used to classify 1055 chemicals into 2 classes : ready and not ready for
biodegradation.
Although our subject is interesting, many of the variables are highly
complex and canâ€™t be understood without a great expertise in
chemistry. This complexity has led us to try to understand only some of
the variables when they created interest for us in the analysis, rather
than all the variables at the beginning.
We used 4 different algorythms and merged them at the end.
You can find the dataset at https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/QSAR+biodegradation. 


This project was a really interesting experience, and teatched us a lot about Python, Datavisualisation, Machine Learning, and how to explain a complex dataset !
